## Description

This is a digital bar where you can get a digital BeeR NFT and/or a digital CoffeE NFT. You have to connect with your wallet (for example Metamask). The you are already in the Bar where you can mint yourself an NFT with a click of a button. It will cost you nothing and you have to pay only for the gas of the transaction. 

The NFTs live on Sepolia test network. You have to change the network from your wallet. You will need some ethers, so go to [https://sepoliafaucet.com/](https://sepoliafaucet.com/) and get some. You can get 0.5 sepolia ethers once every day. 

After you mint yourself NFT, you have to open transaction and view it on block explorer(just follow the link from status of transaction in your Metamask). 
Check for "ERC-721 Tokens Transferred:" and click to see NFT details. There you can find contract address and token ID. These you have to write in your Metamask just to visualize your NFT.

Return to Metamask and click on NFTs section. There is a link: Import NFTs(if you don't see it go to Expand view). Here you put contract address and token ID. 

Cheers!
